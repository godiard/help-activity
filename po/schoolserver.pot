msgid "The XO school Server, or XS, is one of the products of the OLPC project, designed to complement the XO laptop. The XS is installed on x86 (Intel-compatible) computers. These could be conventional servers such as rack-mounted computers, purpose-built low-power machines, or even netbooks."

msgid "The OLPC XS provides additional infrastructure extending the capabilities of the laptops. While the laptops are self-sufficient for many learning activities, other activities and services depend on the XS providing connectivity, shared resources and services. The XS provides XO machines with network connectivity for backups, anti-theft leases, web browsing, system, content updates, and asynchronous collaboration tools such as Moodle."

msgid "The XS has a fairly standard server-style networking setup. The XS provides DHCP and DNS services to all the XOs connected to it via a wireless access point. However, if the school already has its own network running its own DHCP services, the XS networking can be modified to work with the existing infrastructure. The XS can work with two Ethernet cards, where one works as a WAN interface, while the other works as the LAN interface. The XS can also work with a single Ethernet card where it works as a LAN interface for schools without WAN (Internet) connectivity. Optionally, such a server can provide WAN connectivity using a USB-to-Ethernet adapter."
