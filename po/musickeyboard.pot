msgid "By clicking on the small \"Q\" at the top of the screen, the user can set the on-screen keyboard to show the letters and numbers of the corresponding notes on the QWERTY keyboard. This is very helpful for XOs without a touch screen. It should help eliminate the confusion children who have had piano lessons encounter when, for example, the Qwerty C key plays the musical note of E or the Qwerty B key plays the musical note of G. Users can easily see the Qwerty keyboard relationship with this version running."
