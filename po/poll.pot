msgid "A poll is a research tool that helps explain what a group of people think about a subject.  First you present the group with a question and a set of answer choices. Then each person in the group gets to vote for the answer which best describes their personal feelings or opinion.  After collecting votes from the whole group, you look for a pattern in their answers.  You can also ask the same question of different groups (i.e. boys and girls or children and adults) and see how each group answers."
