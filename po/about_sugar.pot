msgid "*\"We like to think that a child's play is unconstrained—but when children appear to feel joyous and free, this may merely hide from their minds their purposefulness; you can see this more clearly when you attempt to drag them away from their chosen tasks. For they are exploring their worlds to see what's there, making explanations of what those things are, and imagining what else could be; exploring, explaining and learning are among a child's most purposeful urges and goals. The playfulness of childhood is the most demanding teacher we have. Never again in those children's lives will anything drive them to work so hard.\" —Marvin Minsky, The Emotion Machine*"

msgid "Sugar is a learning platform that reinvents how computers are used for education. Collaboration, reflection, and discovery are integrated directly into the user interface. Sugar promotes \"studio thinking [1]_\" and \"reflective practice [2]_\". Through Sugar's clarity of design, children and teachers have the opportunity to use computers on their own terms. Students can reshape, reinvent, and reapply both software and content into powerful learning activities. Sugar's focus on sharing, criticism, and exploration is grounded in the culture of free and open-source software (FOSS)."

The term is detailed in Studio Thinking: The Real Benefits of Visual Arts Education. Studio thinking includes \"studio structures\": demonstrations, projects, and critiques; as well as \"studio habits of mind\": develop craft, engage and persist, envision, express, observe, reflect, stretch and explore, and understand the art world. In the context of Sugar, studio thinking is applied not just to the arts, but to all disciplines."

msgid "An interpreted language is a programming language whose instructions are interpreted \"on the fly\" (or compiled to a virtual machine code) as opposed to precompiled. The significance of interpreted languages to the Sugar platform include: platform independence, ease of debugging, ready access to source code, and small program size. Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It emphasizes code readability and features a minimalist syntax and comprehensive standard library."
