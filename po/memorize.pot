msgid "This Activity allows learners to take the learning process in their own hands, as they play but also create their own games. The game has matching pairs of what are clickable tiles, or blocks. The card pairs are composed of text, sound or images. The children turn over the cards to match words, words and sounds, words and pictures, or pictures and sounds. There are a few default games loaded. These images, sounds and text can be extended to animations or movie snippets. Players of Memorize can play together across multiple machines."
