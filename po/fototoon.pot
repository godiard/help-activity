msgid "The FotoToon Activity will allow you to create everything from a simple \"comic\" strip to a long elaborate illustrated document. You will be able to import many kinds of images into the panes of your project and add text bubbles to help tell the story. You can use photo images taken with the XO or imported from a camera, drawings made with Activities such as Paint, and images of all kinds downloaded from the web. This could include photos, charts and graphs, maps, and the like."

The changes are usually minor and should not interfere with the usefulness of this information. Always try to be sure you are using the latest version."
