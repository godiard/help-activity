"There are 3 main folders in the log file list.  The first is the ``.sugar`` "

"The ``.sugar`` folder is the first folder you should look at when "
"troubleshooting Sugar and your Activities.  The ``shell.log`` file contains "
"errors, warnings and debugging information for the Sugar Shell.  The Sugar "
"Shell covers the home and neighborhood views, journal, frame, web services "
"and control panel.  Each activity has its own log file, named using its "
"bundle ID. You can find an activity's bundle ID by opening view source while "
"using the activity, clicking the ``activity`` folder and opening the "
"``activity.info`` file.  If you open an activity for a 2nd time, a separate "
"log file will be created, with ``-2`` added to the end of the file name.  "
"This pattern continues if you run the activity more than 2 times."
