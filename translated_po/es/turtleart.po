"Turtle Art, also known as Turtle Blocks, is an activity with a Logo-inspired "
"graphical \"turtle\" that draws colorful art based on snap-together visual "
"programming elements. Its \"low floor\" provides an easy entry point for "
"beginners. It also has \"high ceiling\" programming, graphics, mathematics, "
"and Computer Science features which will challenge the more adventurous "
"student."

"There are two inter-compatible programs: Turtle Art and Turtle Blocks. "
"Turtle Art, which closely parallels the Java version of Turtle Art "
"maintained by Brian Silverman, offers a small subset of the functionality of "
"Turtle Blocks. Turtle Blocks is the version included in the Sugar "
"distribution. Sugar users probably want to use Turtle Blocks rather than "
"Turtle Art. (Also see Turtle Confusion, a collection of programming "
"challenges designed by Barry Newell.)"

"export programs in Logo, as explained below. There are programmable blocks "
