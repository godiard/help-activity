"The XO school Server, or XS, is one of the products of the OLPC project, "
"designed to complement the XO laptop. The XS is installed on x86 (Intel-"
"compatible) computers. These could be conventional servers such as rack-"
"mounted computers, purpose-built low-power machines, or even netbooks."

"The OLPC XS provides additional infrastructure extending the capabilities of "
"the laptops. While the laptops are self-sufficient for many learning "
"activities, other activities and services depend on the XS providing "
"connectivity, shared resources and services. The XS provides XO machines "
"with network connectivity for backups, anti-theft leases, web browsing, "
"system, content updates, and asynchronous collaboration tools such as Moodle."

"The XS has a fairly standard server-style networking setup. The XS provides "
"DHCP and DNS services to all the XOs connected to it via a wireless access "
"point. However, if the school already has its own network running its own "
"DHCP services, the XS networking can be modified to work with the existing "
"infrastructure. The XS can work with two Ethernet cards, where one works as "
"a WAN interface, while the other works as the LAN interface. The XS can also "
"work with a single Ethernet card where it works as a LAN interface for "
"schools without WAN (Internet) connectivity. Optionally, such a server can "
"provide WAN connectivity using a USB-to-Ethernet adapter."
