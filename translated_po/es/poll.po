"A poll is a research tool that helps explain what a group of people think "
"about a subject.  First you present the group with a question and a set of "
"answer choices. Then each person in the group gets to vote for the answer "
"which best describes their personal feelings or opinion.  After collecting "
"votes from the whole group, you look for a pattern in their answers.  You "
"can also ask the same question of different groups (i.e. boys and girls or "
"children and adults) and see how each group answers."
