"Most education experts agree that the best approach to learning involves "

"questions about the things they’ve done, as opposed to remembering the right "
"answers, we are helping them to build the critical thinking skills that "

"Sugar facilitates reflective learning by ensuring that everything a child "
"does is recorded in an electronic journal which includes screen capture of a "
"child’s work. After every activity, children are encouraged to share their "
"observations, which are recorded in an electronic portfolio. From this "
"record of activities, children can expand their portfolio into a multimedia "
"narrative that shows what they have done, how they have done it and what "
"their thoughts are on what they have created—children essentially become "
"curators of their own work. The child’s process of telling about what they "
"have learned as a “story” is a simple way to help reflection become a norm "
"in their education."

"By building upon the automatic accumulation of work in the Sugar journal, "
"the portfolio process can readily be integrated into the classroom routine. "
"It can be used as an assessment tool to help teachers, parents, and school "
"administrators understand better the depth and breadth of what a child has "
"learned.2 At a “portfolio social”, parents could be invited to view "
"presentations and ask children about their learning. The classroom teacher "
"can add addition assessment slides to the portfolio addressing themes such "
"as work habits and personal growth. This can become part of an archive that "
"travels with a child across grade levels. Through juxtaposition, the child "
"and teacher can see what has changed over the course of the years, trends, "
"and areas for improvement."
