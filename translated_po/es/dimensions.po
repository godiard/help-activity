"Dimensions (previously known as Visual Match) is a pattern-matching game "
"written for Sugar; it is included as part of the Honey collection of Sugar "
"add-ons. The object of the game is to find sets of three cards where each "
"attribute—color, shape, number of elements, and shading—either match on all "
"three cards or are different on all three cards."
