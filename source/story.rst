Learning with Story
-------------------
Story is a fun way to get children to engage in narration. Simply generate some images and let the children's imagination do the rest.


Extending Story
---------------

* Ask the students to transcribe and refine their stories using the Sugar Write activity. (They can save to the Journal the images used to prompt their story and then embed this image into their Write document.)
* A spoken story (or notes) can be recorded to the Journal.
* Story can be shared, so the narration can be created amongst multiple students. They can chain together a story by taking turns; each turn involving generating narration for one image.


Modifying Story
---------------
Add new images to Story by putting them in the images folder of the activity.
