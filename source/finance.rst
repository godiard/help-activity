About
-----

Finance is a simple financial planning activity. It can be integrated into classroom assignments, or else used to track finances for a school club. It might also be useful for students who wish to help their parents with home finances.

The register view allows students to enter income and expenses, assign categories, and review past transactions. The chart view shows students a visual breakdown of their expenses by category. The budget view allows users to assign a monthly budget to each category, and to see how each month's expenses compare to the budget.

Finance is designed to be extensively localized. The user interface is translatable, and local conventions are used to display monetary values.
