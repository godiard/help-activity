About
-----

|Laby_ico|

Labyrinth is a lightweight mind-mapping activity based on an Open Source project called `Labyrinth <https://people.gnome.org/~dscorgie/labyrinth.html>`_. It allows creating mind maps from a mixture of text, freehand drawings, and images from your Journal. There is an infinite sized canvas for your map that can be panned and zoomed while you work. Maps can be "Kept to PDF" for uploading to web sites, sharing, and printing by others who may not be using Sugar.
