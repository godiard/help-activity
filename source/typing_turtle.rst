Typing Turtle is available from the `Sugar Labs Activity Library <http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4026>`__.

Typing Turtle is an interactive touch typing program. It gradually
introduces the keys on the keyboard through a series of lessons, until
the student has learned the entire keyboard. Skills are reinforced with
typing games.
