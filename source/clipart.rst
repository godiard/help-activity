Where to get ClipArt

Library <http://activities.sugarlabs.org>`__:

The source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/sugarlabs/clipart>`__.

Using ClipArt
=============

ClipArt scans Sugar activities for artwork (png, svg, jpg, and gif). It
presents these artworks in a viewer, allowing the user to select images
that are then copied to the Sugar Journal. Once the artwork is in the
Sugar Journal, it is available for use in other Sugar activities.

For example, bundled with the Turtle Flags
activity are images of national flags. Individual flags can be
transferred to the Sugar Journal and used with Write, Fototoons, et al.
