Elementary Arithmetic
=====================

It is easy not to notice that :ref:`counting <counting>` and arithmetic do
not require numbers. People have used beads on an abacus, pebbles on a
Roman counting board, fingers (and sometimes toes), score marks on a
stick, and other devices for counting and simple arithmetic. The
earliest numerals were sets of marks in the appropriate number, such as
Chinese 一二三. The abacus is capable of quite advanced arithmetic in
the hands of a practiced user.

Mathematicians sometimes use purely mathematical constructions such as
sets of sets to represent numbers, and abstract axioms to define
arithmetic. The possibilities are infinite, but three definitions stand
out.

-  The Natural Numbers defined by the Peano Postulates, with Gödel-style
   recursive functions for arithmetic
-  The Hyperreal numbers, based on extensions to the Peano Natural
   Numbers in Non-Standard Arithmetic (Löwenheim, Skolem, Robinson)
-  The Surreal numbers and their extension to games of perfect
   information (John Horton Conway)

(At a comparable point in the song Lobachevsky, Tom Lehrer said, “Bozhe
moi! This, I know from nothing!”) Of these three, conventional
programming languages such as Python support only the familiar Natural
Numbers, and that is all that Turtle Art is set up to use, so we will
stick with them for now. But there is software to work with other kinds
of numbers, and they are quite useful, so I will come back to them
sometime.

-  Comparing numbers (< = >)
-  Addition and subtraction with lines of dots
-  Multiplication with rectangles of dots
-  Division with rectangles, and what to do with the dots left over
-  Multiplication as repeated addition
-  Multiplication defined recursively
-  Abacus arithmetic
-  Numerals
-  Fractions
-  Complex numbers
