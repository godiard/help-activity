Trigonometry
============

Trigonometry got its start in Sumerian astronomy with the division of
the circle into 360 degrees, and with the study of similar triangles,
but did not become systematic until Hipparcos. The three principal trig
functions are defined as in this diagram.

In this diagram based on a unit circle the tangent function of the given
angle is the length of a tangent (Latin *tangere*, touch) to the circle,
and the secant is the length of a secant (Latin, *secare*, cut) from the
center of the circle, cutting the circle and extending to the end of the
tangent. The measure of the angle is the length of the circular arc.
This is known as radian measure.
