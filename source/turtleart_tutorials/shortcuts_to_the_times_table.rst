The Multiplication Table
========================

Here is a multiplication table for the numbers 0-10. With 11 rows and 11
columns, it has 121 entries. Schools routinely order children to
memorize these entries as though they were random facts, with no
relationships among them, and without any help on how to memorize facts.
This is silly and for many children cruel.

Memorization
============

First, let us get pure memorization out of the way. There is no other
way to deal with, say, the names of the 50 US state capitals or the
names of the 100+ chemical elements. They are just names chosen with
almost no system, except for elements 113 and above, which have
temporary numeric names, Ununtritium for 113 through ununoctium for 118.
I don't know why children should know all of either collection of names,
but if your child is assigned to learn them or anything else of the
sort, get a flashcard program such as Anki. You may find a deck already
put together for free downloading with just the information you need,
but if not, making such a deck counts as practicing the material. But
this is not how math works. (It is also not how chemistry works. If you
want to memorize properties of the elements, not just names, if you want
to understand how the number of protons in a nucleus and electrons bound
around the nucleus determine those properties, start with a good
periodic table and study the relationships it shows you.)

Mnemonics
=========

Before the Gutenberg press and movable type launched a revolution that
made books (and later magazines, newspapers and so on) cheap enough for
any literate person to buy or borrow, the Art of Memory was as essential
to a scholar or theologian as it still is to an actor. The Greeks had
Mnemosyne, a Titan, the mother of the nine Muses, just for this
function, and she has given her name to the mnemonics used to make
memorizing easier. You may give thanks for all of the effort that has
gone into creating mnemonics so that you can spend less effort
remembering things, in this case multiplication facts.

First, let us note the **commutative law**, ab = ba, which makes nearly
half of the table redundant. We can divide the table into three parts,
the main diagonal of square numbers, and two :ref:`triangles <figurate-numbers>` of 55
cells each. For multiplying counting numbers, the commutative law just
says that turning a rectangle by 90 degrees leaves it the same size and
shape, as in this Turtle Art program. It has a subroutine stack for
generating a rectangle with given sides, and we can just place the
turtle somewhere and turn it appropriately to get the two views. Try it
with different inputs.


The **square numbers** form a sequence whose differences are the
successive odd numbers, as discussed in 
:ref:`Figurate Numbers <figurate-numbers>`. Here is
the Turtle Art version of that fact again.


Some rows and columns of the multiplication table are really easy.
**Multiplying by 0** always gives 0 (0x = x0 = 0), and **multiplying by
1** always gives the other number (1x = x1 = x). You can **multiply by
10** just by putting a 0 on the end.

**Multiples of 5** all end in 0 (for even multiples) or 5 (for odd
multiples). Multiplying by five is the same as dividing by two and
multiplying by ten,.or the other way around if you prefer.

**Multiplying by 2** is easy if you know how to count by twos, 0 2 4 6 8
10...The result is always even,by definition. Similarly, any multiple of
4 or 8 is even, ending in an even digit. Not only that, but you can
multiply by 4 by doubling twice. And you can multiply by 8 by doubling
three times. So 4 × 7 = 2 × 14 = 28, and 8 × 7 = 4 × 14 = 2 × 28 = 56.

**Next is 9**. In decimal numbers, the sum of the digits of a multiple
of 9 is also a multiple of 9. Thus, 0, (0)9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72,
81, 90. Notice that the tens digits increase from 0 to 9 and the units
decrease from 9 to 0 apart from the 0 at the beginning, keeping the sum
the same. The reason for that is that adding 9 is the same as adding 10
and subtracting 1. If we want to, we can represent 0 as -1 in the tens
column and 10 in the units column, giving 10-10 = 0, and continuing the
pattern of digits. But that's silly. ^\_^ Which doesn't mean that you
can't do it.) The rule for multiplying any digit except 0 by 9 is to
take one less than the digit for the 10s column, and find the digit for
the units that makes the two digits of the answer add to 9. You don't
need this rule for 0 × 9. We dealt with that earlier.

Right, we have done 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. And 10, of course. That
leaves 3, 6, and 7.

Now, you can check that **multiples of 3** (and therefore of 6) have
sums of digits that are divisible by 3, that is, 3, 6, 9, and so on.
When you add 3 to 12, for example, the sum of the digits goes from 3 to
6. When you add 3 to 18, the tens digit goes up by 1, and the ones digit
down by 7, which gives -6. That is, 1+8 = 9, and 2+1 = 3, 6 less.
Carries that go to the hundreds column or beyond are only possible if
those digits are 9, as in 99+3. First we add 3+9, adding 1 to the tens
column and taking away 7 from the units. Then we add the carry, 1, to
the 9 in the tens column, putting 1 in the hundreds column and 0 in the
tens column. The answer is 102, and the sum of the digits is 3.

If you aren't sure what 3 × 8 is, you can look at it several ways.

-  8 is even, so the result is even
-  The answer has digits adding to a multiple of 3.
-  The answer is rather more than 16, in fact it is 16+8.
-  The answer is less than 30, which is 3 × 10.

Which numbers fit that description?

20 No, digits sum to 2 21 No, not an even number 22 No, digits sum to 4
23 No, digits sum to 5 24 Aha! 25 No, digits sum to 7 26 No, digits sum
to 8 27 No, odd 28 No, digits sum to 10 29 No, odd

So there you are. Or, alternatively, you can double 3 three times: 3, 6,
12, 24, or add three 8s: 0, 8, 16, 24.

Multiples of 6 are all even multiples of 3.

Now we have done everything except 7. In fact, there is only one
multiplication fact left, which is 7 × 7 = 49. You might as well
memorize that one as part of the sequence of squares.

Let us summarize. Here is a Turtle Art version of the multiplication
table, colored according to the rules given above. Green entries are the
easiest, multiplying by 0, 1, and 10. Blue is even numbers. Yellow for
5, orange for multiples of 3, 6, 9, and black for 7. The program is
simplified by drawing in the opposite order, hardest to easiest, so that
the colors for the easier rules are on top of the harder ones.


Now, the treatment above is not suitable for children. We have to think
about making a sequence of lesson plans to address one idea at a time.
