Sugar Commander
===============

Sugar Commander is a utility Activity that improves the experience of
working with the Journal. It can do most things the Journal Activity
itself can do with the exception of resuming Activities and copying
Journal entries to files. (These functions are forbidden to ordinary
Activities by Sugar).

Where to get Sugar Commander
----------------------------

Sugar Commander activity is available for download from the `Sugar Activity Library <http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/>`__:
`Sugar Commander <http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4291>`__

The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-commander>`__.


Current Features
----------------

Unlike the Journal Activity, which represents the contents of thumb
drives and SD cards as if they were Journal entries, this Activity has a
tab for files and directories and another tab for Journal entries. You
can choose a file from anywhere in the file system and add it to the
Journal as an entry. You can browse the Journal sorted by title or MIME
type. You can select Journal entries and edit the title, description,
and tags, plus see the preview image, without opening a new window. You
can also delete Journal entries you don't want.
