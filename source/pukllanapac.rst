About Pukllanapac
=================

Pukllanapac is a sliding-puzzle game; the objective is to rearrange
tiles so that all of the circles (and semicircles) are composed of
sectors of the same color. There are three different patterns: circles,
triangles, and hexagons. Drag tiles to swap their positions; click on
tiles to rotate them.

The circle puzzle has three levels of play:

-  beginner, which is a 2×2 arrangement of tiles;
-  intermediate, which is a 4×2 arrangement of tiles; and
-  expert, which is a 6×4 arrangement of tiles.

Warning: the first two levels are relatively easy, but the final level
is challenging.

Pukllanapac is an Incan (Quechua) word for 'picture'. Oscar Becerra was
the inspiration behind the activity.
