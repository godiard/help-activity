Text dungeon

A text dungeon game for literacy and numeracy. The file describing the
dungeon is plain text, it can be edited with an editor such as Write. It
is purposefully unencrypted and easily edited. 'Cheating' by reading or
altering the dungeon is encouraged.

For example, the Sampledungeon represented above is described by these
strings (the comments # are not required)

<u,0,0,lamp,0,1,key,1,1,sword,1,0,princess> #key in room 0,1 , sword in
room 1,1 ,princess room 1,0

<d,0,0,0,0, 0,1,2,0, 0,1,1,1, 1,1,2,1, 1,1,3,0, 1,0,0,0> #room 0,0 north
door open, room 0,1 south open, room 0,1 east door locked etc

Editing example
---------------

For example, put a brick in the room just to the north of the one with
the key :

add the following to the <u command to put a brick in room 0,2 (just
north of room 0,1)

``,0,2,brick``

put open doors going north out of room 0,1 and back, south out of room
0,2 :

add the following to the [d command, (room 0,1 north open, room
0,2,south open)

``,0,1,0,0,Â 0,2,2,0``

Start in room 0,1 (the one with the key) (that reads el,zero,one)

``<l,0,1>``

Start with a parrot in your back pack

``<i,parrot>``

Resetting a dungeon
-------------------

Your progress through the dungeon is saved in the journal entry

your new location, inventory and item locations are appended to the
Journal entry

Write. The Sample dungeon has a marker line of text just before its end
to assist.
