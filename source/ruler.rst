About Ruler
-----------

Ruler is a simple collection of measurement tools that are displayed on
the screen.

Since the OLPC XO computer has a 200 DPI display, the rulers are quite
accurate. One other hardware, where the display resolution is not known,
their is a spinner to let the user set the DPI. Ruler saves this value
to the Journal, so it need not be set on subsequent uses of the
Activity.
