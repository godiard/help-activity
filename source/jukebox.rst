More about Jukebox
------------------

If you open more than one media file, Jukebox will save a "play list" with all the files you selected.
Then you can create list by topics, and open all the files later just selecting the list saved in your Journal.

You can open files located in external devices like a usb device, from Jukebox, without copying them in the Journal,
that is really useful if the files are too big.
