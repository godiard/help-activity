Sugar Features
==============

This page presents a number of Sugar features common to many Activities. The page is designed as a series of "reference topics".

This experimental page includes graphical spacers to separate non-related topics.

.. _View source:

View source
-----------

You always can view the source code of Sugar Activities. In most cases, View Source will show you the python code of the activity, in other cases, like Browse, you can see the HTML code of the page seen in the activity.

You can see the source window pressing Fn-space in your XO or Ctrl-Shift-V or pressing right click on the Activity's icon in the :doc:`/frame`. Here is an example of viewing the source of a page in :doc:`/help` Activity. In the case of this activity, you see the simple text, which Help converts into HTML pages for display. This is useful in the process of editing Help pages as described here :doc:`/how_to_help`

Duplicating activities
----------------------

A option to duplicate an activity has been added to the View Source alert. By selecting this option, a copy of the activity is created in the user's $HOME/Activities directory. Thus we hope to encourage Sugar users to make modifications and improvements to the code they use without the risk of breaking the original activity.

.. _say_selected_text:

Say selected text
-----------------

.. image :: ../images/HelpSpeech1.png

You can have Speak, or robot Alice, read aloud, selected text. Here we demonstrate Alice reading text framed by :doc:`/help`. In Help, for instance, you can select a whole page of text, and have it read aloud to you while you explore that Activity.

Try it now, Select the text in this frame.

To select text, move the mouse to the top left of the text, there is a green arrow near the correct point. Click the left, or main, mouse button. Move the cursor to the bottom right of the text to select, there is a red arrow near the correct point.

Bring in the :doc:`/frame` with the "Frame key" or F6. Press on the "Speech lips" icon in the bottom of the frame, then press on *Say selected text*. Notice also that there is a pause feature, once *speech* has started.

The *Say selected text* feature is available in many text based Activities including :doc:`/browse`, :doc:`/fototoon`, :doc:`/write`. Look out for the "Speech lips" icon in the bottom of the Frame, or as a button in the toolbar of an Activity, as in :doc:`/write`.

.. _journal_qa:

Quick access to the journal
---------------------------

|journal| This icon on the Activity toolbar (or Activity tab) allows quick access to the :doc:`/journal` to add a description, or further notes to yourself about what you are going to do, or have done in that session of the Activity.
