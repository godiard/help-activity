About

|IRC_icon|

The IRC activity allows you to chat with other Sugar/OLPC users and enthusiasts on the Internet via `Internet Relay Chat <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>`_ (IRC).

The activity defaults to a "channel" (akin to a "room") called #sugar on the `Freenode <https://freenode.net/>`_ network, but you can join one of the many channels available by typing ``/join #channel``, where **#channel** is the channel name. Like many Free/Open Source projects, `Sugar <https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar>`_ developers frequent this channel, and are happy to help with any Sugar questions and suggestions you may have.

See the Internet Relay Chat page on `this wiki <http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Internet_Relay_Chat>`_ for a list of Sugar-related channels you can join.
