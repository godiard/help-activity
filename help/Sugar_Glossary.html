<h1>Glossary
  <br />
</h1>
<h2>Access point (AP)
</h2>
<p>A device that connects wireless devices together to form a network. Usually connects to a wired network and relays data between wireless devices and wired devices. Several APs can link together to form a larger network.
</p>
<h2>Active kill
</h2>
<p>A mechanism&nbsp; for remotely shutting down a laptop that has been reported stolen when the laptop connects to the Internet.
</p>
<h2>Activation
</h2>
<p>In order to use your laptop for the first time (or after a “reflash” of the operating system), it must be unlocked by an activation key.
</p>
<h2>Activation key
</h2>
<p>Key that unlocks the laptop.
</p>
<h2>Activity
</h2>
<p>An application that has an icon in the taskbar, e.g., Write, Record, Browse; Activities engage you in taking a picture, reading a book, creating a page, annotating a page, animating a drawing, making sounds and music, measuring and sensing, sharing your favorites, inviting your friends, surfing on the web, etc. has <strong>.xo</strong> suffix
</p>
<h2>Activity view
</h2>
<p> A view used by the current activity that is running on the laptop.
</p>
<h2>BitFrost
</h2>
<p> The OLPC security platform.
</p>
<h2>Content
</h2>
<p>The books, music, movies, photographs, drawings, etc. that are created on the laptop or downloaded to the laptop. Stored in an <strong>.xol</strong> file.
</p>
<h2>Build
</h2>
<p>A Version of the operating system, designated by category and number; e.g., Ship.2-656; Update.1-698; Joyride-1792.
</p>
<h2>Datastore
</h2>
<p>Component that manages the access to the data displayed in the Journal; these data are stored in individual files; an index that contains the metadata and speeds up searches <a name="External_storage"></a>
</p>
<h2>Developer key
</h2>
<p>If the boot firmware sees a developer key, it makes the XO laptop work just like any ordinary PC-style laptop, in the sense that it will let you interrupt the boot process and enter commands; and it will try to boot and run any program you supply to it, no matter whether the OLPC organization has tested or signed it. (The laptop also works this way if its firmware security is disabled.)
</p>
<h2>Email list
</h2>
<p>A collection of email addresses—an efficient way to send email to a group of people who share an interest
</p>
<h2><strong>Firmware, Wireless</strong>
</h2>
<p> The wireless firmware is software that controls the operation of the wireless radio. It is downloaded into the wireless radio by the operating system.
</p>
<h2>Firmware, System
</h2>
<p>The system firmware is made up of 2 parts: The EC and OFW. The first part is the software that runs the embedded controller (EC). The EC handles the processing of the keyboard, touchpad, game buttons, power button, and charging the battery. The second part is OpenFirmware (OFW). OFW is responsible for initializing the hardware and booting the operating system. OFW also handles boot security so that it will only load “official” OLPC operating systems.
</p>
<h2>Frame
</h2>
<p>The Frame, which can appear in any view, hollds system status (battery, network, etc.), a clipboard, the list of open activities, navigation controls, and list of “buddies” (collaborators);
</p>
<h2>Group view
</h2>
<p>A view of your friends with whom you are working on shared projects.
</p>
<h2>Home view
</h2>
<p>View of installed activities from which you launch them—the Home view is the starting view on the laptop.
</p>
<h2>Hover over
  <br />
</h2>
<p>To move the pointer over something on the screen (such as an icon) and leave it there for a moment. Often, hovering over an object's icon activates a menu of options for that object.
  <br />
</p>
<h2>Infrastructure mode
</h2>
<p>Network connectivity through a WiFi access point, e.g., 802.11b.
</p>
<h2>Internet Relay Chat
</h2>
<p>IRC/chat real-time text chat used by the development and technical support communities (and hopefully the learning community as well)
</p>
<h2><strong>Jabber</strong>
</h2>
<p>A protocol that the laptop uses for collaboration.
</p>
<h2><strong>Journal</strong>
</h2>
<p> Activity where you can see your previous work. You can also resume the work done at those activities.
</p>
<h2>Jumpdrive
</h2>
<p>A small, external storage device that plugs into one of the USB ports on a computer. They can store between 16MB (enough to hold several music files) up to 4GB (enough to hold several high quality full-length movie files) and a wide range in between. Jump drives are easily purchased at any electronic store starting as low as $5 to $10.
</p>
<h2><strong>Key generation</strong>
</h2>
<p> Process of generating both activation and developer keys.
</p>
<h2><strong>Lease</strong>
</h2>
<p> When a laptop is activated, the activation has an expiration date. The period between activation and expiration is the lease period. The lease period is determined during the key-generation process; the laptop can be reactivated after the lease has expired.
</p>
<h2><strong>Library</strong>
</h2>
<p> Content that is created on the laptop is accessed through the Journal; preloaded content is stored in a library and is accessed through the Browse activity.
</p>
<h2><strong>Malware</strong>
</h2>
<p> Malware is software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner's informed consent. Linux is relatively robust in light of malware and Rainbow provides additional protections above and beyond the standard Linux defaults.
</p>
<h2>Memory stick
</h2>
<p> See Jumpdrive
</p>
<h2><strong>Mesh Channel</strong>
</h2>
<p> The laptops use three channels for communication: 1, 6, and 11; in simple mesh mode, the laptops can only see other laptops on the same channel; in a School Server mesh, laptops on all channels are visible.
</p>
<h2><strong>Mesh Network</strong>
</h2>
<p>A wireless mesh network is a communications network made up of radio nodes in which nodes can forward information on behalf of each other so that even nodes that are not in direct radio contact can communicate via nodes that are between them. The collective coverage area of the radio nodes working as a single network becomes a mesh cloud.
</p>
<h2><strong>Mesh Mode</strong>
</h2>
<p>Network connectivity through a mesh network, e.g., 802.11.
</p>
<h2><strong>Mesh Portal Point</strong>
</h2><dl><dt><strong> </strong>A mesh node that serves as a gateway (portal) to a network external to the mesh.</dt></dl>
<h2>NAND Flash
</h2>
<p>Internal storage in some laptops, including the OLPC XO.&nbsp;
  <br />
</p>
<h2><strong>Neighborhood View</strong>
</h2>
<p>A view of who is on the network with you and what activities and content are being shared.
</p>
<h2><strong>Operating System</strong>

</p>
<h2><strong>Palette</strong>
</h2>
<p>A black box that appears when the mouse hovers over an object; a palette can contain the name of the control, some details about it or some related actions.
</p>
<h2><strong>Passive kill</strong>
</h2>
<p> Currently unsupported, this is a mechanism that uses the lease mechanism to require laptops to periodically ask for a renewed activation. Without the renewal, the lease will expire and the laptop will be locked.
</p>
<h2>PO file
</h2>
<p>A file containing the instance of translated strings for a single language based upon a POT file
</p>
<h2>Pootle
</h2>
<p>A server that is used to store and manage translation templates and files.

<h2>POT file
</h2>
<p>The master translation template for a projec.
</p>
<h2>Power adapter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</h2>
<p>Each laptop comes with a power adapter to allow it to be plugged into a power socket.
</p>
<h2><strong>Presence</strong>
</h2>
<p>A discovery service for finding other laptops on the network.
</p>
<h2><strong>Rainbow</strong>
</h2>
<p>Rainbow implements the isolation shell implicitly described in the Bitfrost security specification. This means that it isolates activities (and eventually system services) that it is asked to run from one another and the rest of the system.
</p>
<h2><strong>Reflash</strong>
</h2><dl><dt> The process by which a fresh build is installed in the laptop; reflashing overwrites all files, including files in the <em>Journal</em> and /home/olpc. And so, it should be done with caution. </dt></dl>

</p>
<h2><strong>Signed/unsigned builds</strong>
</h2>
<p>OLPC produces both "signed" and "unsigned" builds of the operating system. Signed builds are release builds that have undergone QA testing. Unsigned builds are development builds, which are used for testing new features and bug fixes. You cannot run an unsigned build in your laptop unless you have either a developer key or security has been turned off (as in the case of the G1G1 laptops).
