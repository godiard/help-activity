Instructional sequence:

       Step				                                    	Assessment Criteria
            
1. Use the tools in the Pippy Activity   
                                                    Number of tools/ object used to create a Project/Program
                                                    Effectiveness and uniqueness of each step     
                                                    Being able to independently use the activity                                               

2. Presentation of studentâ€™s own Project
                                                    Presentation skills (clarity, eye contact)
                                                    Content (python concepts, purpose of using pippy)


3. Q&A	  
                                                    Able to answer on the spot
                                                    Confidence



Milestones Achieved:
Students now can use Pippy without any Problem.
They can create Proper programs in Python covering various aspects of it. 



Students now can create different and innovative programs and projects using Pippy and learn more about it. 
They can also explore more Activities.This will help get insight of Computer Programming and can develop a passion towards it.



An assignment on the basics of python and how to use Pippy would be perfect for the evaluation 
and will also help teacher to get to know about his/her teaching methodology.
